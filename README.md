### **Open any computer file or internet link faster and easier!**

This program was initially made for people that want to visit certain webpages constantly. Multiple bookmarks can now be avoided by just inserting the **internet links** in the application and clicking the relative buttons. Web browser doesn't need to be running in order to use this program. The user may also execute other windows **applications** or open **folders** and **documents** by specifying the full file path when adding a new button.

Multiple instances of this application can be used in order to separate their functionality and create a folder-like structure. The user may create multiple copies of the **_.exe_** file and rename it as they prefer. They may later add the newly creating copy of the **_.exe_** file to their desired button and succeed on creating a folder-like structure.

Your buttons are saved as a **_.xml_** file at your desired location. You may modify that **_.xml_** file and the effects will take place next time you launch the application.

2) Loading a **_.xml_** file marks it as the _"latest save file"_ and you can easily overwrite it using the overwrite button

### Update log: 30/12/2022 ([Download this version (1.0.1)](https://github.com/GianniosApostolos/EzLaunchr/releases/tag/v1.0.1))
1) Users are now able to rearrange the buttons to their liking. No more unecessary **_.xml_** file modifications!

### Update log: 17/12/2022 ([Download this version (1.0.0.2)](https://github.com/GianniosApostolos/EzLaunchr/releases/tag/v1.0.0.2))
1) Users can now add background images on their created buttons.

2) Users can double click on the description textbox when editing their button to change the color of the description label. This can give new customization options and might help with clarity when they use background images on their buttons.

There is a template image which can be used as a guide to create images that will fit in your buttons. It can be located in the **_Images_** folder. Image should be 115x120 (width x height). And a padding of 25px should be left from the top side. Otherwise part of the image will be covered by other controls. 


### Update log: 15/12/2022

1) Users can now manually save their **_.xml_** and no longer need to save when closing the application.
2) Users can now load from another **_.xml_** file and reload the whole application.
3) Closing the main application form no longer opens the save dialogue. Users need to save manually.
4) Shrinking the form will hide the SAVE/LOAD Buttons in order to remove visual clutter. Expanding it, will reveal them again.
5) Users can now create buttons with empty descriptions. Empty link buttons are not supported intentionally.

1)  ~~Users will be able to add an image when creating buttons.~~

### Known bugs / issues that will be looked into (everything stated below can be found in the Issues tab as well):

**SQUASHED** ALL KNOWN BUGS!ðŸ˜Ž


1)  ~~If user doesn't specify a link and/or a description when creating a new button. The program doesn't load the problematic button on startup.~~
2)  ~~The application always asks for a save file location. This can be annoying if there were no changes in the app. The user can skip the saving stage if they  close the prompt~~
