### **Open computer files or internet links faster and easier!**

This program was initially made for people that want to visit certain webpages constantly. Multiple bookmarks can now be avoided by just inserting the internet links in the application and clicking the relative buttons. Web browser doesn't need to be running in order to use this program. The user may also execute other windows applications by specifying the full file path when adding a new button.

Multiple instances of this application can be used in order to separate their functionality and create a folder-like structure. The user may create multiple copies of the **_.exe_** file and rename it as they prefer. They may later add the newly creating copy of the **_.exe_** file to their desired button and succeed on creating a folder-like structure.

Your buttons are saved as a **_.xml_** file at your desired location when you close the program. You may modify that **_.xml_** file and the effects will take place next time you launch the application.


### Future updates may include (in no specific order and exluding fixing bugs):

1)  Users will be able to add an image when creating buttons.
2)  Edit button will have image support 
3)  Users will be able to load from another **_.xml_** file and reload the whole application
4)  Will porovide application customization settings for the user and might change the UI.

### Known bugs / issues that will be looked into (everything stateed below can be found in the Issues tab aswell):

1)  If user doesn't specify a link and/or a description when creating a new button. The program doesn't load the problematic button on startup.
2)  The application always asks for a save file location. This can be annoying if there were no changes in the app. The user can skip the saving stage if they  close the prompt

HOW TO FIX known bug no 1: Button needs to have both link and description when created. If you, by any means, create a problematic button, you can change its properties by clicking the edit button "‚úê" or by changing the **_.xml_** file that is created when you close the application.
