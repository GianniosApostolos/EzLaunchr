### **Open computer files or internet links faster and easier!**

This program was initially made for people that want to visit certain webpages constantly. Multiple bookmarks can now be avoided by just inserting the internet links in the application and clicking the relative buttons. Web browser doesn't need to be running in order to use this program. The user may also execute other windows applications by specifying the full file path when adding a new button.

Multiple instances of this application can be used in order to separate their functionality and create a folder-like structure. The user may create multiple copies of the **_.exe_** file and rename it as they prefer. They may later add the newly creating copy of the **_.exe_** file to their desired button and succeed on creating a folder-like structure.

Your buttons are saved as a **_.xml_** file at your desired location when you close the program. You may modify that **_.xml_** file and the effects will take place next time you launch the application.
